## *Module 4, Challenge - Portfolio key risk management metrics & analysis*
### example analysis of key metrics: daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas




The purpose of this project was to assume the role of a quantitative analyst for a FinTech investing platform. The task at hand is to offer clients a one-stop online investment solution for their retirement portfolios thatâ€™s both inexpensive and high quality.

The goal is to systematically evaluate four new investment options (funds) for possible inclusion in the client portfolios. In so doing, determine the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas.

Beyond the scope of the assignment, the author sought to conduct additional analysis of the data obtained and demonstrate further visualization with combined data plots, overlay plots, and heatmap visualization.  Supplemental and/or extra analysis beyond the scope of the project is noted as 'supplemental' were approrpiate.

## **Methods**

The code script analysis performed:
    
   Individually set path to CSV file called 'whale_navs.csv' from the Resources folder using the Path module.
   Use `read_csv` to read in csv file, generate dataframe setting the DatetimeIndex with 'date' as as index. 
   Set the parse_dates and infer_datetime_format parameters
    
        
   Individually prepare the dateframe by - 
   converting the dataframe of NAVs and prices to daily returns and
   cleaning missing and / or erroneous data using dropna() missing values.
   Review the first or last five rows of the DataFrame using `head()` or `tail()` functions.
        
   Quantitative analysis has several components: performance, volatility, risk, risk-return profile, and portfolio diversification.
   Daily returns were obtained with the Pandas `pct_change()` function together with `dropna()` to create the daily returns DataFrame. 
   Dataframe was then visualized with `plot()` function.  Cumulative returns are   generated with the Pandas `cumprod()` function. 
        
        `cumulative_returns = (1 + daily_returns).cumprod() - 1`
        
   Cumulative returns are then visualized with .plot() function.
   Volatility is visualized using daily return data to create box plots to visualize the volatility of the 4 funds and the S&P 500.
   The risk profile of each fund was analyzed using standard deviation and the beta.
  
### Mean
   - $\mu = \frac{\sum{x_{i}}}{n}$

The average value for a given `list` or `Series`


### Variance
   - ${S}^2 = \frac{\sum{ (x_{i} - \mu })^{2}}{ n - 1}$

The squared average change around the mean
 

### Standard deviation
  $\sigma = \sqrt{S^{2}}$

The square root of the variance
 
  
   The Pandas `std()` function is used to calculate the standard deviation for each of the four portfolios and for the S&P 500
   This was further analyzed via plot visualization of annualized and rolling 21-day values.
           
          `daily_returns_std = daily_returns.std()` 
          `annualized_std = daily_returns_std * np.sqrt(trade_days_year)`
          `daily_returns.rolling(window=21).std().plot()`
            
   SUPPLEMENTAL ANALYSIS was then introduced by the author.
   The `corr` function was used to calculate correlations for each fund pair.
   The `heatmap` function from the Seaborn library was used to create a heatmap of correlation values visualization.
   
![all_funds_htmap](images/heatmap.png)    
   
   
   
   Additional information about the heatmap method from seaborn on the [documentation page](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html#seaborn.heatmap).

   Using the `mean()` function, daily return DataFrame was used to calculate the annualized average return data for the four fund portfolios and for the S&P 500.

### Mean
   - $\mu = \frac{\sum{x_{i}}}{n}$


          `annual_average_returns = (daily_returns.mean()*trade_days_year)`


   Using the numpy `np.sqrt()` function, 252 trading day, and presumed risk-free return rate of zero, risk-return profile was then examined through calculating 
   the Sharpe ratios for the four fund portfolios and for the S&P 500.
   

 

          `sharpe_ratios = annual_average_returns / (daily_returns.std() * np.sqrt(trade_days_year))`
          
   The Sharpe ratios for the four funds and for the S&P 500 were then visualized in a bar chart

![all_funds_sharpe](images/sharpe1.png)
### Sharpe Ratio
   $\frac{R_{p}}{\sigma_{p}}$

The ratio between the average annual return and the annualized standard deviation (risk-free rate =0).  

     
   SUPPLEMENTAL ANALYSIS was then introduced by the author.
   comparitive analysis was conducted between Sharpe ratios based on risk free return rates (hurdle rate) being zero or 3% (0.03)
   These comparative Sharpe ratios for the four funds and for the S&P 500 were then visualized in a bar chart
   
![all_funds_sharpe](images/sharpe2.png)
### Sharpe Ratio
   $\frac{R_{p}-R_{f}}{\sigma_{p}}$

The ratio between the annual average return minus risk free rate of return and the annualized standard deviation; includes a significant risk free return rate 3%
   
   
        
   At this point, two funds were selected for continuation of analysis as greatest potential candidates.
   The Pandas `var()` function was used to calculate the variance of the S&P 500 by using a 60-day rolling window
   for the two selected funds, covariance was calculated using the 60-day rolling window, the daily return data, and the S&P 500 returns.
### Variance
   - ${S}^2 = \frac{\sum{ (x_{i} - \mu })^{2}}{ n - 1}$            
            
   Review the last five rows of the covariance of the funds was performed with `tail()` function.  The beta of each fund was calculated by division of
   the covariance of each fund by the variance of the S&P 500. The Pandas `mean()` function was used to calculate the average value of the 60-day rolling 
   beta of the funds.
    
   At this point the primary required analysis was complete.  The author then conduct some additional supplemental calculations for visualization.  
   Examples are demonstrated below.

* [Path](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html?highlight=path#module-pathlib) - From 'pathlib', Object-oriented filesystem paths, used to identify a file

For additional and / or supplemental processing and visulaization this project also makes use of the following packages:
